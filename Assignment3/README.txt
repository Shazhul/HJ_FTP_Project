Language: Python2.7

We implemented the extra credit. There is a folder with multiprocess code and another with multithreaded code. 

Instructions
	Use either the multiprocess code or the multithreaded code. 
	Run the server as 'python2.7 server.py <PORT NUMBER>'
	Run the client as 'python2.7 client.py <SERVER ADDRESS> <SERVER PORT>'
	Multiple clients can connect to the server at once. 
	The client can run 4 commands:
		ls - lists all the files on the server
		get <filename> - gets the file from the server and saves it locally
		put <filename> - puts the file from the client and saves it on the server
		quit - exits the client
